Automated-Web-Server-File-Lister
================================

Automated Web Server File Lister is designed to create a recursive file listing for a particular folder at every specified time interval. It is fairly error tolerant and will not shut down if an error is incurred. Designed for use on a web server, Automated Web Server automatically ignores hidden folders (i.e. those beginning with '_') and the listing it generates is in HTML format.  Created by Craig Lotter, February 2005 | Project Details:  Coded in Visual Basic .NET using Visual Studio .NET 2003 Implements concepts such as file handling and timer programming. Level of Complexity: simple
